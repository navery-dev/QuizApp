# QuizApp

Multi-choice question quiz platform to help users study for quizzes, exams, certifications, ect. 

The application would allow the user to upload their study questions and answers in a CSV or JSON format. The site will then organize those into knowledge sections and break questions down into additional modules, if needed. The user would then be able to quiz themselves on the content and track their learning progress over time.
